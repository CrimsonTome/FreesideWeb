# closebracket interview

### Tell us a bit about your time at Freeside 
The better question would be what didn't I do! I started the Student Resources List and contributed to other projects such as revamping the Freeside website. I organised hoodies, stickers and press coverage alongside promoting Freeside at University events and talks alongside badgering lectures to talk about Freeside. 

### What was the most important lesson/skill you learned during your time at Freeside?
I learned how to communicate and organise across a wide variety of needs, which is really important if you're considering project specifications, system design or how well your team is working together; but it's also important to drive projects forward because this will often involve communication and organisation that can take weeks and sometimes months to feed back into a project - so it takes a lot of goodwill, patience and diplomacy. 

### How have the skills learned at Freeside impacted your career?
Interestingly, I get asked about Freeside at every interview I attend because its something employers rarely come across and the skills I developed are a great example of how I can benefit their organisation so it positively impacts and gives me an advantage over other candidates. 

### What advice would you give to present students/freesiders?
Absolutely throw yourself into everything Freeside does and if there is something Freeside isn't doing that you believe it should be, just make it happen. Persistence is key.
